# Summer-HTML
This is the final assignment for the Summer 2018 Term HTML class with Eric Poitras. 
The Jquery file is missing CLick events, I couldn't figure out how to bind the .click event to the buttons in the card deck. 
Because of this, I left the jumbotrons beneath the card deck (originally, I'd planned to hide them initially, and then show them when the user clicked on the appropriate card's button). But I couldn't get it to work so I left them in.
